## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Good practice of CSS positioning, Grid and Flexbox. Also interesting layout changes.

### Continued development

I need to improve my planning skills. I used a mobile first approach. In some cases I had to go back and alter the HTML code for things to work as I needed them. I could save time with better planning rather than diving in head first.
